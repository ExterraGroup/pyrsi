                                  end_date=datetime(year=2021, month=12, day=31))

Accessing ship information:

.. code-block:: python

    from rsi.shipmatrix import ShipMatrixAPI
    ship_matrix = ShipMatrixAPI()
    ship = ship_matrix.ships[170]      # ships is a dictionary, keys are ship IDs
    ship = ship_matrix.search_by_name('kraken')

Accessing citizen information:

.. code-block:: python

    from rsi.citizen import fetch_citizen
    fetch_citizen('ventorvar')

Accessing org information:

    member = org.members[0]
    members = org.search('fuzzy_handle_matching')     # list of members using fuzzy matching
    member = org.search_one('fuzzy_handle_matching')  # returns only the top match
